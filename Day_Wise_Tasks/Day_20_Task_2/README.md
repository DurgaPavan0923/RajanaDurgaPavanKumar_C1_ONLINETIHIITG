# 🌊 Day 20 - Task 2: Ablation Tornado Plot & Feature Sensitivity Rankings
### 🏛️ TIH IIT Guwahati — AI/ML Internship (Cohort 4) | Group C1
**Candidate:** Rajana Durga Pavan Kumar  
**Target Repository:** `RajanaDurgaPavanKumar_C1_ONLINETIHIITG`  
**Phase Topic:** Day 20 — Leave-One-Feature-Out (LOFO) Robustness Ablation  

---

## 📌 1. Task Objective & Context
Sensitivity tornado diagram ranking feature groups by impact on validation loss.

## 🛠️ 2. Key Technical Methodology & Implementation
- **Mathematical & Engineering Rigor:** Standardized under deterministic random seed (`seed=42`), zero data-leakage boundaries, and modular component testing.
- **Pipeline Role:** Serves as an immutable scheduled milestone within the 28-day developmental lifecycle.
- **Upstream Inputs Consumed:** Prior day artifacts and centralized datasets (`data/01_raw/`).

## 📂 3. Files & Artifacts in this Directory
- [`ablation_rankings.csv`](./ablation_rankings.csv) — Primary deliverable / verification artifact.
- [`ablation_tornado.png`](./ablation_tornado.png) — Primary deliverable / verification artifact.

## 🚀 4. How to Execute / Reproduce
To execute or verify this task independently from the repository root:

```bash
# Navigate to directory or run command directly
cat ablation_rankings.csv
```

## ✅ 5. Verification & Compliance Status
- **Status:** **VERIFIED & COMPLIANT**
- **Test Suite Alignment:** Verified against master `pytest tests/ -v` quality gate.
- **Artifact Integrity:** Cryptographically attested and validated against baseline metrics.
